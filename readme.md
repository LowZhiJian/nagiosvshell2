# Nagios V-Shell

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/chrislaskey/nagiosvshell.svg?branch=2.x)](https://travis-ci.org/chrislaskey/nagiosvshell)

A modern visual shell for Nagios

## Enhancement by Soft-Skills Sdn Bhd and UTAR

This is a collaboration project between Soft-Skills Sdn Bhd and students of Universiti Tunku Abdul Rahman (UTAR). This project aims to develop the remaining interface of Nagios V-Shell v2 for internal usage. 

The README steps below are obtained from the original Nagios V-Shell v2 project. (https://github.com/NagiosEnterprises/nagiosvshell/tree/2.x)

## Alpha Release

Nagios V-Shell `2.0.0-x` is currently documented, tested, and stable.

There are two features are planned for the official `2.0.0` that are not
currently implemented:

- Frontend i18n language support
- Backend caching using PHP APC

Otherwise the alpha release is feature complete.


### Release Feedback

Nagios V-Shell does not modify any Nagios files and installs to a separate
location. Both the alpha and Nagios V-Shell v1 can be run alongside eachother.

Users are encouraged to try the alpha release and give feedback by submitting
[GitHub issues](https://github.com/NagiosEnterprises/nagiosvshell/issues). This
will allow all alpha users a single place to join the discussion and help shape
the future of the project.

Please include the specific release version when starting a [new
issue](https://github.com/NagiosEnterprises/nagiosvshell/issues/new). The
release version is available in the included `package.json` file or by visiting
the options page through the web interface, `/vshell2/#/options`.


## Live Demonstration

A live demonstration is available on the [project
website](https://nagiosenterprises.github.io/nagiosvshell/).

Note the frontend is reading cached API output and rendering the
results. As a result, timestamps in the demo will not be current.


## Installation


### Prerequisites

Nagios V-Shell is compatible with Nagios XI and Nagios Core 3.X.

V-Shell requires Apache and PHP 5.3 or higher. 


### Installing

The latest version of Nagios V-Shell is available on the official
[GitHub project page](https://github.com/NagiosEnterprises/nagiosvshell).

With root permissions clone the latest version:

    cd /tmp
    git clone https://github.com/NagiosEnterprises/nagiosvshell

Next, checkout the alpha release branch:

    cd nagiosvshell
    git checkout 2.x

Then verify the values in `config.php` are correct. Sensible defaults are
included for RHEL/CentOS 6 and Debian 7, and may require no action.

    vim config.php

The last step is to run the installation script:

    ./install.php

The installer will output meaningful errors if anything goes wrong during
installation. Once complete, Nagios V-Shell will be available at
`http://yourserver.com/vshell2`.


### Updating and Installation Details

Nagios V-Shell mean to be installed with little risk involved. It does not
touch existing Nagios XI or Nagios Core system files. The official nagios
web-interface always remains accessible in the default location.

The newest V-Shell v2 is backwards compatible with V-Shell v1, both versions
can run side-by-side.

Updating V-Shell is done through the same installation process. Existing vshell
files in `/usr/local/vshell2` are automatically backed up into time stamped
directories in the `/usr/local/` directory.

Configuration details can be updated in the `/etc/vshell2.conf` file.
Note, some configuration options will require restarting Apache and PHP.


### Large Installations and APC Caching

Nagios V-Shell can take advantage of the Alternative PHP Cache system (APC),
which is of particular importance if you are managing a large installation. For
information about APC and installation instructions see the [APC
Documentation](http://php.net/manual/en/book.apc.php).

Nagios V-Shell is configured to automatically detect and use APC caching
if it installed. APC caching caches object configuration data each time there is
a change to the objects.cache file, and it caches status data based on the TTL
config option in the vshell.conf file. If TTL=90, V-Shell will cache data from
the status.dat file for 90 seconds before re-parsing the file.

Note: since APC uses system memory to cache data, it is recommended to increase
the `memory_limit` in the `php.ini`.
